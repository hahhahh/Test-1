        <h2>Short Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Eleanor Hume (エレノア・ヒューム Erenoa Huumu?) is a protagonist in Tales of Berseria. She lost people precious to her during the Scarlet Night, so she joined the Abbey as an exorcist. During her extermination of daemons, she encounters Velvet Crowe on several occasions.
          </p>

        <h2>Appearance and Personality</h2>
          <p class="infoboxtext">
            Eleanor has light skin, green eyes, and reddish hair. She wears a pale gold dress with a blue overcoat, colors of the Abbey. She is a kindhearted and compassionate woman. In addition, she tries to affect an air of ruthlessness and logic that is expected of an exorcist, but her true nature shines though. She never forgets that she joined the Abbey to help people, and when she has exterminated daemons, she also listens and tries to help the populace in general. Eleanor's mother was killed by daemons when she was young, an act that solidifies her resolve and faith in the Abbey's mission.
          </p>
          <p>
            Holding a serious, reserved demeanor when it comes to her job, Eleanor is initially seen as just another exorcist acting on behalf of the Abbey. Her early encounters with the group show this, but Eleanor's weaker, more vulnerable side appears on several occasions as well, notably during her first encounter with Velvet. Although she attempts to hide her emotions, they often spill over when her sense of justice drives her to do good and better the world around her despite knowing she will always be unable to help everyone, a "shortcoming" she blames herself for. Her encounter with Velvet and the others within Loegres's Grand Cathedral leaves her confused and conflicted when countered with the group's vague motives and the Abbey's secrets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eleanor's submission to Velvet for the sake of serving as Laphicet's vessel following her defeat in their duel eventually becomes one of willingness as she begins to question the Abbey's "reason". While she does manage to warm up to Velvet and the others over time, her inner struggle becomes a quest of her own, seeking the answers kept hidden from her despite secretly following Artorius Collbrande's orders still. Having lost her own mother, Eleanor develops a strong bond with Kamoana due to the similar fate of her mother, and after learning that Kamoana's mother's death was the Abbey's doing, she abandons her exorcist role.
          </p>

        <h2>Fighting Style</h2>
          <iframe id="EizenIFRAME" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X-k-pUvt40E" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <p>
            Eleanor specializes in wielding her spear, using it for wide, sweeping attacks not unlike Alisha Diphda from Tales of Zestiria. Her martial artes are spear attacks, focused on thrusting and a few of them drain enemy's HP, while her malak artes focus on the Fire element. She is a good close and mid-range attacker, while lacking the ability to fight at long distance. Eleanor's Break Soul is Aerial Strike, which is a rising sweep that knocks enemies into the air. She can eventually learn abilities that allow her to follow them into the air and perform aerial combos. Her mystic artes are Spiral Hail, which is a series of thrusts that ends with a vortex at the end of her spear, Lostfon Drive, and Gungnir Twister. She also shares a dual mystic arte with Magilou known as Excelion Pierce.

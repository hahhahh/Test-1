      <h2>Short Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Shigure Rangetsu (シグレ・ランゲツ?) is a major antagonist in Tales of Berseria. He is a legate-rank exorcist from the Abbey and Rokurou Rangetsu's older brother, serving as the head of their family. They use a unique fighting style in their aims to become the strongest warriors.
        </p>

        <h2>Appearance and Personality</h2>
        <p>
          Shigure is a tall, muscular man with golden eyes and long black hair. He dons a unique shirt that simply covers his shoulders and the top portion of his back, leaving his torso mostly exposed, the shirt being connected in the front by a black and orange material that yields an ornamental fang. He wears a full arm gauntlet on his right arm, with which he wields a large sword, and a partial arm gauntlet on his left. His pants mirror the same color motif as his top, being mostly beige and trailing into a combat-oriented pair of black and orange sandals. Though a legate, Shigure has a free-spirited attitude unappreciated by the serious-minded exorcists. He justifies his carefree behavior with his battle prowess. His sole joy is to fight tough opponents and seems to enjoy it when his opponent is stronger. He will never turn down a new challenge whenever it arises.
        </p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          He killed his mother not to become the current family head but because she was strong, then inherited the family sword Stormhowl. His younger brother went on to spread rumors about him in order to be justified in slaying him. He eventually joined the abbey. Along the way he fights his brother and wins. The last time that they fight he asks Morgrim his malak to undo his bindings so he can go all out, encouraging the rest of the group to join in the fight to make it more interesting. After a long fight, Rokurou and Shigure go one-on-one, and clash each of their blades against each other. Rokurou then performs a technique he had been practicing to disarm Shigure of Stormhowl with his daggers, leaving him wide open, and in a perfect opportunity to strike, Rokurou unsheathes Stormquell and slashes Shigure through his chest. Dying, Shigure was happy that he had such a good fight, and is proud of his brother's efforts. Rokurou reveals that he was the one who spread the rumors but he already knew. He asks the group to spare Morgrim which he jokingly refers to as "that fat cat", to which they agree, and Velvet devours his body to claim his soul afterwards.

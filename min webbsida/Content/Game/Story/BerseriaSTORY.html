  <h2>Setting</h2> <!--finns i generalstyling-->
    <p> <!--finns i generalstyling-->
      Berseria takes places in a world known as Desolation, specifically in the Holy Midgand Empire, a powerful country that rules over Desolation's archipelago of a continent. The game's world is shared with Tales of Zestiria, though these events occur in the distant past. There are countless numbers of islands around, and Midgand's rule crosses even the seas. Areas of land and islands in the game are divided into territories. Along with humans, one of the other main races is the malakim, supernatural spirits whose wills are sealed and used by humans as slaves to utilize their magical abilities after being made visible to even normal humans due to the Advent, an incident three years prior to Velvet Crowe's escape from the prison island of Titania.
    </p>

    <p> <!--finns i generalstyling-->
      Throughout the empire, a disease known as daemonblight causes those infected to lose their humanity and sense of rationality and transform into monsters known as daemons, who pose a threat to the world. Along with the rulers of the Holy Midgand Empire exists a theocratic order known as the Abbey, who are of great political and religious importance and are influential in imperial affairs. The exorcists, soldiers from the Abbey, are tasked with bringing peace and order by purging the world of daemons and are willing to go to extremes to reach their goal.

  <h1 class="Arial">Story</h1> <!--finns i generalstyling-->
    <h2>Prologue</h2> <!--finns i generalstyling-->

    <p> <!--finns i generalstyling-->
      When she was a child, Velvet and her younger brother, Laphicet Crowe, were saved by her brother-in-law, Artorius Collbrande, when a Scarlet Night occurred and the daemonblight consumed their village, Aball. Velvet's pregnant older sister, Celica Crowe, is killed by the disease through an event known as the Opening. A few years later, Velvet lives with Laphicet and Artorius in the same village. The Scarlet Night returns, with the entire village succumbing to the daemonblight. When Velvet finds Artorius, she witnesses him sacrifice her brother as part of a ritual known as the Advent.

      Artorius attempts to use her for the Advent as well, but she resists and the daemonblight possesses her arm, mutating it and turning her into a daemon called a therion, with the ability to absorb daemons. In a rage, she slaughters the surviving daemons, then witnesses the summoning of malakim into the world, including a reincarnated Celica, now an emotionless malak called Seres. She is thereafter thrown into a prison for daemons on the prison island of Titania, swearing to kill Artorius and avenge her brother's murder. Over the next three years, Artorius forms the Abbey to bring peace to the Holy Midgand Empire and is seen as a savior by the people for establishing the exorcists.

      After three years in prison, Velvet, now embittered and possessing the power to absorb and produce malevolence from her mutated arm, is freed by Seres, who has regained her emotions and broken away from Artorius, who is declared as the Shepherd by the Abbey. During her escape, Velvet also aids the samurai Rokurou Rangetsu and witch Magilou. During the escape, Velvet and Seres fight against the praetor-rank exorcist Oscar Dragonia, and Seres takes a fatal attack when Oscar turns one of his malakim servants into a dragon to face them. Absorbing Seres at her own request, Velvet makes a final attack on Oscar that blinds him in one eye before he escapes.
    </p>

    <p> <!--finns i generalstyling-->
      Velvet, Rokurou, and Magilou then escape the island on a ship. Over the course of their journey, they also meet Eleanor Hume, who is one of the Abbey's exorcists but beginning to doubt their methods; Laphicet, a malak formerly in service to praetor-rank exorcist Teresa Linares until breaking free and traveling with Velvet; and Eizen, a malak who travels with pirates that grant the group sanctuary. Eleanor is initially reluctant to join Velvet, attempting suicide before being stopped by Laphicet and learning the full truth behind the Abbey's plans. They eventually learn that Artorius, Oscar, Teresa, and legate-rank exorcists Shigure Rangetsu and Melchior Mayvin are trying to purge the daemonblight by erasing all emotion from humankind. To do this, they need to summon Innominat, the Empyrean of Suppression, an extremely powerful malak, into the world.
    </p>

    <p> <!--finns i generalstyling-->
      The group learns through an ancient tome that Innominat, depicted as a dragon with eight heads, is connected through earthpulses, areas of the world where its mana is highly concentrated, to seven therions, daemons similar to Velvet. The therions devour daemons, whose energy is then absorbed by Innominat in order for him to be summoned into the world. Artorius, Oscar, Teresa, Shigure, and Melchior are ultimately successful, with Innominat taking on the form of Velvet's deceased brother. It is also revealed to the group early on that daemonblight is actually an impurity called malevolence generated by the negative emotions of humanity, which can turn humans into daemons, and that daemons and malakim are visible to only humans who possess resonance in them.
    </p>



    <h2>An End and a Beginning</h2> <!--finns i generalstyling-->
    <p> <!--finns i generalstyling-->
      Due to Artorius's actions during the Opening and the Advent, the latent resonance in humanity amplified, allowing for daemons, followed by malakhim, to become visible. Laphicet is revealed to be the reincarnation of Celica's unborn son, and that Velvet, being a therion herself, is able to produce malevolence from her mutated arm when she absorbs daemons, and is even declared by both the Abbey and the populace as the Lord of Calamity. In order for the group to defeat Artorius and Innominat, they pursue each of the exorcists, defeating them and using them as vessels to awaken the four Empyreans.

    <p> <!--finns i generalstyling-->
      They then face Artorius, who merges with Innominat in the final battle before Velvet kills him once and for all. Innominat begins going berserk, and Velvet decides to seal herself away with him, nourishing him with her malevolence while being with the brother she loves. Laphicet becomes Innominat's replacement with the help of Oscar, Teresa, Shigure, and Melchior, reincarnated as the four Empyreans who will serve Laphicet as his lords. Laphicet then transforms into a benevolent dragon and purifies the land of malevolence, at the cost of humans not being able to see the malakim. Magilou records the events of the world in her role as a scribe, while Laphicet renames himself "Maotelus". These events ultimately foreshadow and set the scene for Tales of Zestiria.
